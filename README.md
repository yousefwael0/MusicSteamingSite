# ðŸŽµ MyMusic â€“ Online Music Streaming Website (Frontend Only)

This is a simple frontend project that recreates the look and feel of an online music streaming service. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript** with minimal logic and beginner-friendly structure.

## ðŸ§± Features
- Landing page with call-to-action
- Login/Register form
- Music page with working audio player
- Responsive design using Bootstrap
- Basic styling and branding

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
3. Click "Browse Music" to go to the player page.
4. Press "Play" on any track to test the audio player (requires sample `.mp3` files in `assets/audio/`).

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- This is a **frontend-only mockup** â€” no backend or database is connected.
- Music files must be added manually to `assets/audio/` for playback to work.
- The play button is connected to a simple `<audio>` tag using JavaScript.
